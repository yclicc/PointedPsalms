1 Why do the nations conspire * and the peoples | plot in | vain? ||
2 The kings of the earth rise up * and the | rulers | band to|gether
    against the Lord and a|gainst · his an|ointed, || saying, *
3 ‘Let us break their chains * and | throw | off their | shackles.’

4 The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord | scoffs at | them. ||
5 He rebukes them in his anger * and terri|fies them | in his | wrath,
saying, * 6 ‘I have inst|alled my | king || on | Zion · my | holy | mountain.’

7 I will proclaim the Lord’s decree: * He said to me, ‘You | are my | son; ||
    to|day · I have be|come your | father.
8 Ask me, * and I will make the nations your inheritance,
    the ends of the | earth · your poss|ession. ||
9 You will break them with a rod of iron; *
    you will | dash them · to | pieces · like | pottery.’

10 Therefore, you kings, be wise; *
    be warned, you | rulers · of the | earth.
11 Serve the Lord with fear * and | celebrate · his | rule with | trembling.
12 Kiss his son, * or he will be angry
    and your way will | lead to · your de|struction, ||
    for his wrath can flare up in a moment. *
    Blessed are | all who · take | refuge · in | him.
